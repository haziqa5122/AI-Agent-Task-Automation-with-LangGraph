# AI Agent Task Automation with LangGraph 🧠⚙️

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to use [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) for task automation with AI agents. LangGraph is a library for building **stateful, multi-agent workflows** powered by LLMs, built on top of LangChain.

## 📝 Notebook Overview

The notebook walks you through:

- Setting up LangGraph and related dependencies
- Creating AI agents using LangChain
- Building a LangGraph to represent a task automation workflow
- Orchestrating the communication and decision-making between multiple agents
- Running and visualizing the graph to observe AI behavior

This example showcases how AI agents can be structured as a graph and used to **automate complex tasks** using clear logic and coordination.

## 🔧 Requirements

Make sure to run the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or a similar Python environment with the following:

- Python 3.8+
- `langgraph`
- `langchain`
- `openai` (or any LLM provider)
- `networkx`
- `IPython.display` (for visualization)

All required libraries will be installed in the notebook itself.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open the notebook in Colab:  
   [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/haziqa5122/AI-Agent-Task-Automation-with-LangGraph/blob/main/Task_Automation_with_LangGraph.ipynb)

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the cells.

3. Replace the placeholder API keys (e.g., for OpenAI) with your own if needed.

4. Run the notebook to observe the agents in action!

## 📌 Use Cases

- Workflow automation  
- Multi-agent collaboration  
- Intelligent decision-making systems  
- Research on AI agent behavior and coordination
